# Deploy from Cursor

- **To update the live app:** Commit and push to `main`. GitHub Actions will run and deploy to Fly.io automatically.
- **Triggers:** Pushing changes under `apps/web/**` (or `packages/ui/**`, etc.) triggers "Deploy Web to Fly.io". Pushing under `apps/api/**` triggers "Deploy API to Fly.io".
- **Workflows use:** `flyctl` (not `fly`) in `.github/workflows/deploy-*-fly.yml`.
- See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for secrets and one-time setup.
